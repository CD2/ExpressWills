Nearly there – the property Life Beneficiaries are not appearing in the will (they should come out in the first sentence (“I give all my interest in the property known as X to Y and Z who are living at my death (Life Beneficiary)…”
 
Addresses seem to be missing commas, and I managed to create a property as follows: “6.2 I give all my interest in the property known as 1 1 1 1, , to 1 1 of 1 1 1 1 who are living at my death (Life Beneficiary) for the life of that individual.” Not sure where the extra comma came from.

 
The lists should also finish with a semi-colon (;) except the penultimate which should have (; and) and the last one should be a full stop.
