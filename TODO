 
• The question "Is the property to be held on trust for the life of one or more individuals" should have "No" pre-selected as default. 
/•  The question field "Life beneficiary no" should read "Number of life beneficiaries" 
• I can't see how to edit the property beneficiaries/life beneficiary once I have proceeded? I click on the Property and go back to it, to put number of life beneficiaries, change its address if I want, etc, but when I click Proceed it now takes me straight to Personal Gifts? 
• Personal Gifts - "You can make specific gifts of personal items" is repeated under the title. Please replace the second one with "Recipient details" in bold 
• Personal Gifts - It should be possible to leave County blank 
• Residuary - When asked if you want to leave stuff to a beneficiary, can the pre-selected option be "Individual" rather than "Charity"? Otherwise I see people becoming confused and trying to leave an individual gift by filling in the charity details form. Same for Secondary Beneficiaries
/•  Residuary - Can "Beneficiary type" not have "Type" capitalised? 
• Can capital advancement have "50%" pre-selected (but leave it at the same place in the list, do not put it randomly at the top thanks!)
